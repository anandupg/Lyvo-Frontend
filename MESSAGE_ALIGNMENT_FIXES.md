# ✅ Message Alignment Fixes - Seeker & Owner Messages

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed:**

The seeker message area was showing all messages as **left-aligned** (like owner messages), but it should show:
- **Seeker messages**: Right-aligned with red background
- **Owner messages**: Left-aligned with gray background

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **1. Seeker Messages (SeekerMessages.jsx):**
- **Fixed**: Proper message alignment based on sender
- **Seeker messages**: Right-aligned with red background (`bg-red-600`)
- **Owner messages**: Left-aligned with gray background (`bg-gray-100`)
- **Enhanced**: Better message bubble design with rounded corners and tails

### **2. Owner Messages (Messages.jsx):**
- **Updated**: To match the same modern design as Seeker Messages
- **Owner messages**: Right-aligned with red background (`bg-red-600`)
- **Tenant messages**: Left-aligned with gray background (`bg-gray-100`)
- **Enhanced**: Consistent styling and layout

## 🎨 **Visual Design:**

### **Message Alignment:**
```jsx
// Seeker Messages:
- Seeker's own messages: Right-aligned + Red background
- Owner's messages: Left-aligned + Gray background

// Owner Messages:
- Owner's own messages: Right-aligned + Red background  
- Tenant's messages: Left-aligned + Gray background
```

### **Message Bubble Design:**
```jsx
// Sent messages (own messages):
className="bg-red-600 text-white rounded-2xl rounded-br-md"

// Received messages (other person's messages):
className="bg-gray-100 text-gray-900 rounded-2xl rounded-bl-md"
```

### **Message Layout:**
- **Modern rounded corners**: `rounded-2xl`
- **Message tails**: `rounded-br-md` for sent, `rounded-bl-md` for received
- **Responsive sizing**: `max-w-xs sm:max-w-sm md:max-w-md lg:max-w-lg`
- **Better spacing**: `space-y-3` between messages
- **Improved padding**: `px-4 py-3` for better readability

## 📱 **Consistent Features:**

### **Both Seeker and Owner Messages now have:**
1. **Proper message alignment** based on sender
2. **Modern chat bubble design** with rounded corners
3. **Auto-resizing textarea** for message input
4. **Consistent color scheme** (red for own messages, gray for received)
5. **Better responsive design** for all screen sizes
6. **Improved typography** and spacing
7. **Read receipts** with check marks for sent messages
8. **Proper timestamp formatting** (12-hour format)

## ✅ **Result:**

Now both Seeker and Owner message areas have:
- **Correct message alignment** (right for own messages, left for received)
- **Consistent visual design** across both interfaces
- **Modern chat UI** with proper message bubbles
- **Better user experience** with clear message distinction
