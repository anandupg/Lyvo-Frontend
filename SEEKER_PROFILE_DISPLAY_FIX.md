# Seeker Profile Age & Gender Display Fix

## ðŸš¨ Problem Identified
The age and gender fields were being **saved to the database** but **not displayed** in the frontend after updating. This was due to:

1. **Missing state update**: After successful API response, `profileData` state wasn't being updated with the new values
2. **No debugging visibility**: No console logs to track what data was being sent/received

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed State Update After Save
**Added proper `profileData` state update** after successful API response:
```javascript
// Update profileData state with the new values
setProfileData(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  name: result.user.name || "",
  email: result.user.email || "",
  profilePicture: result.user.profilePicture || "",
  phone: result.user.phone || "",
  location: result.user.location || "",
  age: result.user.age || "",
  occupation: result.user.occupation || "",
  gender: result.user.gender || "",
  bio: result.user.bio || "",
  isVerified: result.user.isVerified || false
}));
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debugging
**Added console logs** to track data flow:
- **Initial load**: Shows what data is loaded from localStorage
- **Update payload**: Shows what data is being sent to API
- **API response**: Shows what data is returned from backend
- **Final state**: Shows what data is set in profileData state

### 3. Improved Update Payload Structure
**Separated payload creation** for better debugging:
```javascript
const updatePayload = {
  name: profileData.name,
  phone: profileData.phone,
  age: profileData.age ? Number(profileData.age) : null,
  occupation: profileData.occupation,
  gender: profileData.gender || null,
  bio: profileData.bio
};

console.log('SeekerProfile: Sending update payload:', updatePayload);
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

### 1. Test Profile Update
1. **Login as seeker**: Use `seeker@test.com` / `password123`
2. **Go to profile page**: Navigate to `/seeker-profile`
3. **Click Edit button** to enable editing
4. **Update age and gender**:
   - Set age to `25`
   - Set gender to `male`
   - Set phone to `9876543210`
   - Set occupation to `Software Engineer`
5. **Click Save Changes**
6. **Check browser console** for debug logs

### 2. Expected Console Output
```
SeekerProfile: Loading user data: { name: "Seeker User", age: null, gender: null, ... }
SeekerProfile: Sending update payload: { name: "Seeker User", age: 25, gender: "male", ... }
SeekerProfile: API response: { message: "Profile updated successfully", user: { age: 25, gender: "male", ... } }
SeekerProfile: Updated profileData: { age: 25, gender: "male", phone: "9876543210", occupation: "Software Engineer" }
```

### 3. Verify Display
- âœ… **Age field** should show `25` (not "Not provided")
- âœ… **Gender field** should show `Male` (not "Not provided")
- âœ… **Phone field** should show `9876543210`
- âœ… **Occupation field** should show `Software Engineer`
- âœ… **Form should exit edit mode** after successful save

### 4. Test Persistence
1. **Refresh the page**
2. **Check that values persist** after page reload
3. **Verify localStorage** contains updated data

## ðŸ”§ Key Changes Made

### Before (Not Working):
- `profileData` state not updated after API response
- No debugging visibility
- Values appeared to save but didn't display

### After (Working):
- `profileData` state properly updated with API response
- Comprehensive debugging logs
- Values save AND display correctly
- Proper state synchronization

## ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause
The main issue was that after a successful profile update, the component was updating the `user` state and localStorage but **not updating the `profileData` state** that controls the form field values. This caused the form to show old values even though the data was saved correctly.

---

**Age and gender fields should now save AND display correctly!** ðŸŽ‰
